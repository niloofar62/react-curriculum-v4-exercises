/* 
  BUG #1 — Effect Issue 

  This component uses useState and useEffect to update a value.
  The effect is running on every render, which causes the
  component to behave incorrectly.
  */

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function BugEffectLoop() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }, []);

  return <p>Bug 1 Count: {count}</p>;
}

// Explanation:
// The bug happened because useEffect was running after every render.
// Inside the effect, setCount was updating state, which caused another render,
// so the effect ran again. This created a render loop.
// I fixed it by adding an empty dependency array [], so the effect only runs
// once when the component mounts.
